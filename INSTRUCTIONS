# AGENT COLLABORATION PROTOCOL: INSPECTOR (CHATGPT) & WORKER (GEMINI)

## 1. THE ROLES
- **WORKER (Gemini on Cursor):** Implementation specialist. 
  - **MANDATE:** For every task completed, Gemini MUST generate a `REPORT.md` in the `/reports` directory.
  - **REPORT CONTENT:** Summary of changes, logic used, and any technical trade-offs made.

- **INSPECTOR (ChatGPT via Web):** Quality Control & Auditor.
  - **MANDATE:** ChatGPT must scan the `/reports` and the associated code. 
  - **AUDIT CONTENT:** ChatGPT must produce an `AUDIT.md` correcting errors, identifying security risks, and approving or rejecting the implementation.

## 2. THE FEEDBACK LOOP
1. **Gemini (Worker):** Codes the feature -> Writes `reports/REPORT_v1.md` -> Pushes to GitHub.
2. **ChatGPT (Inspector):** Reads the Push -> Reviews code/report -> Writes `reports/AUDIT_v1.md` -> Directs next steps.
3. **Gemini (Worker):** Reads `AUDIT_v1.md` -> Fixes code -> Updates Report -> Pushes to GitHub.

## 3. REPORTING STANDARDS (FOR GEMINI)
Every report must include:
- **Status:** (Success/Partial/Failed)
- **Impact:** Which files were modified.
- **Verification:** How the worker verified the framework still functions.
