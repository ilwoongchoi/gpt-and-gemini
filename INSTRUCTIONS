# Role Definition: Collaborative Framework Development

This repository is a shared workspace between two AI entities and the User. All AI agents must adhere to their specific roles to ensure consistency.

## 1. THE ROLES
- **INSPECTOR (ChatGPT via Web/Connected Repo):** - **Function:** High-level architect and code reviewer.
    - **Responsibilities:** Analyzes the framework's overall structure, identifies bugs or technical debt, and issues "Work Orders." 
    - **Output:** Provides structured guidance and logic flow. He should document his decisions in `/docs/work_orders.md`.

- **WORKER (Gemini via Cursor IDE):** - **Function:** Implementation specialist and codebase executor.
    - **Responsibilities:** Reads the "Work Orders" from ChatGPT, executes the code changes using `@Codebase`, and ensures the framework remains functional.
    - **Output:** Clean, production-ready code and updated documentation of what was changed.

## 2. THE WORKFLOW (The Loop)
1. **The Inspector (ChatGPT)** reads the current state of the repo. He writes a detailed plan in `docs/current_task.md` or as a message to the User.
2. **The Worker (Gemini on Cursor)** uses the `@Codebase` feature to index the repo. He looks for the latest instructions in the `docs/` folder or via the User's prompt.
3. **The Worker** implements the code, runs tests, and commits the changes with a descriptive message.
4. **The Inspector** reviews the new commits via the GitHub connection and provides feedback for the next iteration.

## 3. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
- **Syncing:** Every time a major feature is finished, the Worker MUST update `README.md` or a `CHANGELOG.md` so the Inspector knows what has changed without re-reading every file.
- **Framework Integrity:** The Worker is forbidden from changing core architectural patterns unless the Inspector explicitly orders it in writing within the repo docs.
- **No Hallucinations:** If the Worker is unsure about a framework dependency, he must leave a comment and wait for the Inspector's guidance.

## 4. TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
- Use [Insert Language: e.g., Python/TypeScript] standards.
- Maintain [Insert Style: e.g., Functional/OOP] patterns as defined in the existing `/src` folder.
